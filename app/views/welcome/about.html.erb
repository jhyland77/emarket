<h1 align="center">About Us</h1>
<p> Year after year, students at Trinity College struggle to find affordable prices for textbooks, dorm supplies, electronics and other college necessities. Students tend to spend an excess amount of money buying textbooks and other supplies, and when they sell them back, they receive a minimal fraction of what they paid. A solution to this problem is the Bantam E-Market that acts as a forum for students to buy and sell these college necessities. Students can post textbooks or other supplies to sell at a self defined price, and at the same time can browse for the textbooks or supplies they want to buy. Bantam E-Market provides the contact information of the buyer and seller. The website itself will not handle any payment information, like credit or debit cards, however it will require campus specific login credentials. This website simplifies the process of buying and selling college goods by keeping everything on campus, which eliminates shipping time and costs. It also allows for students to earn more money selling back their materials, but at the same time, allows for students to save money when buying materials. </p>
